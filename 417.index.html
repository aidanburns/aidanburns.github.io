   417<br><br>

it has been 417 days. no more, no less.<br>
i shut my front door with my heel and read the date and time.<br>
i remembered what i did before, and repeated it,<br>
i took the tape from the drawer on the table,<br>
scribbled on the back of a spare envelope with a black marker<br>
and stuck it to the wall.<br><br>

it has been 417 days. no less. <br>
i am gradually forgetting the events of that day,<br>
every morning and night, glancing over the paper<br>
i recall less and less,<br>
one head disappears from a photo,<br>
one voice disappears from a crowd,<br>
and in their place there is no alien,<br>
there is no shapeshifter taking them,<br>
no conspiracy, no killing,<br>
no nebulous grey cloud.<br>
they are simply not there.<br><br>

it has been 417 days. no more.<br>
i reflect on their features, i try and commit to memory <br>
the details of their face, or the warmth of their hands,<br>
scribbling down anything i can grasp,<br>
designing a person. tomorrow is their last day.<br>
i sit on my living room floor and stare far<br>
into the vague concept of a person i knew.<br><br>
