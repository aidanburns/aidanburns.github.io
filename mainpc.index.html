   MAIN PLAYABLE CHARACTER<br><br>
   
   tell me that I’m a phantom<br>
and that I’m not really here <br>
I float through the halls and the voices echo<br>
inside around for hours<br>
he sees himself with a third person camera<br>
he wants to change his name <br>
but leave halfway through the procedure <br>
he wants to leave himself an incomplete person in the eyes of the law<br><br>

are you aware of your single remaining life?<br>
keep searching for another one, go through<br>
your friends desks and turn the objects over,<br>
keep writing the names and places flow from<br>
your head again<br><br>

he needs to know something else is there<br>
he needs to converse with us at last<br>
you need to bury his feet in the dirt<br>
and have him talk for as long as he can<br>
don't let him get up<br><br>
