   A LOST RADIO TOWER OFF THE COAST OF ALASKA<br><br>
their little boat<br>
emerged from the cave<br>
slowly, rocked side to side<br>
and set a course for home<br><br>

the crew,<br>
in orange hi-vis jackets<br>
held onto the sides,<br>
sat and whistled<br>
then their sensors picked up something<br><br>

a large metal structure<br>
two thousand metres below the surface and sinking,<br>
slowly, they retrieved their hooks<br>
and threw them over the side,<br>
the rope whirring as it reached farther and farther down<br>
until<br><br>

they hooked the mesh<br>
and brought it back up<br><br>

it was a few minutes<br>
until they saw what they found<br><br>

a blinking red light,<br>
fixed to a radio tower,<br>
wires and all<br><br>

a few reached for their radios<br>
a few secured the tower to their tiny boat<br>
and one looked up and saw the sun<br>
rising over the ocean<br>
at once, their jackets shone a great yellow<br>
they heard an acoustic guitar coming from the radio<br>
the waves drowned out the static<br><br>

they stood,<br>
in awe of it all for a little while<br><br>

and the engine kicked in<br>
and they sped off<br>
back to record their findings<br><br>
