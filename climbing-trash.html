		<h1 class="subheading">Overview</h1>


		<p><b>Climbing Trash to Heaven Before they Close the Door</b> is an arcade game made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024">2024 GMTK Game Jam</a>, following the theme "Built To Scale". It was built from the 16th to the 20th of August 2024 alongside Sylvie Freeman and Jaydn Jones.</p>
		
		<p>I was the programmer, project manager, and contributed to the overall design. <a

		<h1 class="subheading">Production Trial by Fire</h1>
		<p>This was the first game jam I'd ever participated in! I ended up acting as the group's producer as well as programmer, so it was my responsibility to manage everybody's time, set deadlines and coordinate the team to avoid bottlenecks. I used a huge Kanban board to track everything that needed to be done, and was sure to take regular breaks to maintain my sanity.</p>

			<p>This was my first time using Obsidian's Kanban feature for project management, I've used it for every project since.</p>

		<h1 class="subheading">Designing and Programming at Speed</h1>
		<p>It was enjoyable to work to a new set of guidelines: instead of trying to make the most polished project possible, I had to work at speed, and design around our limitations. For example, I'd planned to allow the player to jump originally, but I had to consider cutting the feature as it would have taken too long to get right, and the game ended up working much better with a "glide" function instead.</p>
		<p>After some testing, I realised that reaching a high point wasn't an interesting enough goal, and simply encouraged players to build a big tower, which wasn't what we imagined during our initial sketching phase. So, I changed the goal to instead be about collecting gems that would appear on alternating sides of the screen, encouraging players to create zig-zagging stacks of blocks, which was a lot more fun.</p>

		<h1 class="subheading">Reflection</h1>
		<p>I'm very happy with the game as my first game jam title: I had a great opportunity to work with my friends, and created something that's quite fun to play. Even my dad thought it was pretty good! It was a significant learning opportunity for me too, as I can now see the easy fixes I missed, and how the game could have been even better, if I had taken a few extra breaks and let myself relax a little more.</p>
		<p>I was also delighted that the other team members let me keep the name.</p>
