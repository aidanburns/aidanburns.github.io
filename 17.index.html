   17<br><br>

inside the attic of the house there was a fog,<br>

a lilting, languid sort of thing, it felt like forgetting<br>

to raise your head above the collapsing ladder<br>

and into that space. for the life of me<br>

i can't sense what it looked like,<br>

holding out my hands in the dark,<br>

running along the wiring on the gently crumbling walls<br>

to find that lightswitch that never came.<br><br>

my brother found something in the blackness,<br>

on a family holiday; he stayed behind<br>

and waved to us from the window as we left<br>

before turning into the hallway and gazing upwards,<br>

through the ceiling, layered with carbonated concrete<br>

and heat-resistant foam. when we returned<br>

and picked him up he felt lighter, like there was less to hold.<br><br>

a small hole appeared in my ceiling, nearly microscopic, but<br>

it was more than enough. the fog sept into my bedroom,<br>

it circulated, it looked at me when i slept.<br>

i saw my knees buckle, a soft chill touched my spine<br>

as i turned, fell into bed, slept for days.<br>

i stumbled down the stairs, a sole memory blurred before me,<br>

seeing vestiges on my skin like handprints and inkblots,<br>

and there was a resounding silence<br>

as my smothered body refused to shatter.<br>
