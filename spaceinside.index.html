  SPACE INSIDE<br><br>

at last, she was adrift on the ocean<br>

with no sign of land. it had been a long time coming.<br>

she had thought about running away from home,<br>

but this was far safer, far less dramatic,<br>

it wasn’t as sharp.<br><br>

everything had been okay until the new pain hit her -<br>

the rain fell with a crash, her bones were brittle.<br>

she forgot everything before that point,<br>

she wasn’t meant to be there.<br>

someone called down from a high window<br>

and met a desolate space.<br><br>

the memories arrived with the waves,<br>

in swathes, rolling back and forth, pressing down on her shoulders.<br>

the reflections in the water cracked like a smashed guitar,<br>

she felt a faint goodbye echo over the miles,<br>

the moon beaming like a match above her head.<br>
