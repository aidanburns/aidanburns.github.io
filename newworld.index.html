   WELCOME TO THE NEW WORLD<br><br>

swear on your life that you wont move a<br>
muscle from this point<br>
chain yourself to the ground<br>
leave behind a small part of yourself<br><br>

you can move upwards<br>
you can float through your words<br>
you've freed your mind from its shackles<br>
join the rest of us without the weight<br>
can you hear the anthems?<br>
move freely now<br><br>

i want you to know how proud we are of your accomplishments<br>
you are another legend of a man in our nameless ranks<br>
fill your new empty space with weapons of was<br>
and fight in your hometown<br>
buy into the hate with all of your lost love<br>
and believe and fight for the good of mankind<br><br>
