   GLACIER<br><br>

you can take me apart if it’ll make me lighter<br>

and easier to carry, cut me into ribbons<br>

and tie them together, hoist it over your shoulders<br>

and take it down the river,<br>

i’ll sit at the back where it’s quiet<br>

and i’ll keep your boat from sinking<br>

into the water, it’s cold like winter when you’re three years old<br>

and the wind cuts your pale face,<br>

—you remember what happened?—<br>

and it spun you and it twisted your neck with its forearms<br>

and sharpened your jaw into something that<br>

couldn’t be seen,<br>

—i don’t want to hear—<br>

but you stretched towards the heavens<br>

casting shadows like burning oil<br>

over me, scarring my collarbones,<br>

over us, like melting red tar,<br>

still under the raw skin on my neck<br>
