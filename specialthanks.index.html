   <b>(this is the original special thanks)</b><br><br>
   
   thank you for reading my book<br>
if you enjoyed it please consider leaving a review<br><br>

this project would not have been possible without:<br>
my mum and my dad for always giving their feedback and sorting out the logistical end of this whole thing so I didn’t have to<br>
my brother, for being just the best sibling<br>
my friends, for either actually being interested in something I was making or for not completely dismissing the idea<br><br>

as for inspirations, both for poems and in general:<br>
Dom McLennon, Hideo Kojima, Akira Yamaoka, dunkey, the Celeste team, Hidetaka Miyazaki, Thomas Pynchon, John Green, Jon Blow, Cupboard, Davey Wreden, Bo Burnham, Vlambeer, Tyler Joseph, Daft Punk, Kanye West, Toby Fox, bad schools<br>
And anybody or anything else I’ve forgotten.<br>
I hope to see you again soon.<br><br>

	hey. thanks for reading to the end. looking back on this project was weird.<br>
	i quite like some of these. and others are kinda just real bad. but i hope you liked looking through.<br>
	i wanted to preserve this stuff in a way that's not in a janky word document, or behind a paywall.<br>
	here are some specific credits, for who inspired what.<br><br>
	
	campfire was inspired by Dom McLennon's final verse / line on MILK.<br>
	bright blue was inspired by Camp Omega from MGSV: Ground Zeroes. this makes me kinda uncomfortable.<br>
	blue moon was inspired by Silent Hill, notably the soundtrack by Akira Yamaoka.<br>
	raincoat uses ideas and feelings from Celeste.<br>
	pigeons was inspired by the introduction to Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon.<br>
	face the lights is a boring take on Car Radio by Tyler Joseph.<br>
	parade was inspired by the approach to ASGORE's castle in Undertale, and the song that plays as you walk.<br><br>
	
	now that everybody knows how much of a hack i was, i hope you have a nice day.<br><br>
