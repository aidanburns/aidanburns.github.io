	PIGEONS<br><br>
it was dark out<br>
the town was dimly lit<br>
and there was a noise coming from somewhere<br><br>

the people buzzed like flies<br>
they moved quickly, anxiously<br>
together, away from whatever was coming for them<br><br>

they had heard it before, but nothing like now<br>
they decreed it true,<br>
the Light was coming, the Wall of Fire!<br>
for them!<br>
the Supernova!<br><br>

they started to move,<br>
away, through dark alleys and the tunnels<br>
but where are they going?<br>
not a global migration but a collective knotting into,<br>
as they grew weary and short of breath,<br>
they slowed and shielded their eyes<br><br>

and all that was left<br>
were their bags<br>
and the pigeons<br><br>
