   ISLAND SONG<br><br>
   
   she dreampt of a world full of dogs<br>
   she sat in a field and whistled her song<br>
   they came running over the crumpling walls<br><br>
   
   she fed them with a spoon made of oak<br>
   in small wooden bowls, the dogs took them<br>
   with them back into the forest<br><br>
   
   her own stayed by her side, chewed on the<br>
   spoon and sat in her lap, it seemed to melt into the grass<br><br>
   
   they sat like ancient marble statues life that for<br>
   years. she left one day, into the sky, slowly. she<br>
   looked down to her island, it was the most<br>
   beautiful thing she'd ever seen.<br><br>
