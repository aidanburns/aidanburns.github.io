   DOWNPOUR<br><br>

One night when i was six years old my dad wanted to take me stargazing, and i couldn’t choose between staying with my mum or going with him, i cried because i didn’t know what to do and i had to decide. I was in the car with him and we travelled down unfamiliar roads and turns and hills in the dark. We reached the site, the cold was biting and there were about ten guys my dad’s age standing around high-tech telescopes, they told me about how they had automatic rotation and magnification settings to observe the planets in detail. The small LED screen showed things that were many many years away, and as i stood in the field and it started to rain, i couldn’t stop feeling as if i had failed. <br><br>

The rain froze, it floated a metre above the ground. The stars seemed closer now, i felt as if i could climb with my gloves and boots and reach out and touch them. I climbed further away, and i knew that i wouldn’t fall, my dad was stood below me, he protected me.
I climbed to the moon that day, i touched the rocky surfaces of mars and venus, they gave me a surface to jump from, and i bounded from planet to planet like they were stepping stones. I felt the heat of the sun and it was kind, i knew what i would see at the centre. He waited for me with open arms, i couldn’t wait to see him. We saw how far we had come together, it brought us both to tears. The sun grew over time and soon there was nothing left in the world, but i knew that i was safe in his hand-stitched embrace.<br><br>
