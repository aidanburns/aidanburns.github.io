   CAVE PAINTINGS<br><br>

the lights went on forever<br>
the elevator came to a complete stop and he<br>
stepped out into the tunnel.<br><br>

above his head, the lights stretched upwards<br>
into the sky, thousands of grapsing<br>
hands with torn nails. beside him lay their<br>
thoughts and beliefs, the bricks violently<br>
splayed with colour. the history of the city lay<br>
before him, he saw their hearts and minds sit<br>
abandoned and alone.<br><br>

even in death and memory, he still saw form<br>
and it scared him. even in death and<br>
rememberance, they were crushed under the<br>
weight of the rock.<br><br>

the bombs fell. strings of firecrackers went off <br>
across the city and he could not believe his<br>
eyes. the words of Prometheus crumbled like<br>
bucket sandcastles in the path of the tide, the<br>
bombs broke down his most devout beliefs.<br><br>

he built his home where it once lay, he built a<br>
small statue. the sun shone through the rubble<br>
and a small gratine child reached for the sky.<br><br>
