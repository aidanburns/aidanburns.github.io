   APRIL TWENTY-FOURTH<br><br>

we all turned the corner and got into the car,<br>
the lock on the left side had long been damaged by frost<br>
so i held it shut closely as we swerved<br>
around corners and empty intersections<br>
at just a hair under the speed limit.<br><br>

somebody had this or that errand to run,<br>
and so we stood outside the post office<br>
and watched as the sky gradually changed colour,<br>
slowly melting between greys and blues,<br>
and listened to the birds call for their friends<br>
from above the buzzing lights<br>
inside the post office. they finally emerged<br>
and remarked at how hard the concrete suddenly felt<br>
after waiting on the spotted brown carpet<br>
for almost an hour,<br>
or at least what felt like almost an hour.<br><br>

we hoisted the box into the boot<br>
and tried not to hear it slide and crack<br>
as the driver suddenly started and stopped,<br>
because the radio was on.<br>
we pulled into the car park on the dark street<br>
next to the restaurant, narrowly missing the wall<br>
and in the light of the main street, a man stood<br>
leaning against the old bricks<br>
in a deep red suit and polished shoes.<br>
‘this bloody guy again’, we muttered<br>
as we walked around the corner<br>
and tried not to make eye contact with him.<br><br>

squinting through the sun,<br>
we reached the restaurant, at last,<br>
and we slid into a booth and ordered four cheeseburgers,<br>
one with pickles, one with onions,<br>
and a plate of sweet potato fries.<br><br>

and ‘we forgot the damn sodas’, we realised, out loud,<br>
and so began to glare and point<br>
at whoever we felt was most deserving<br>
of being made to go and ask for the sodas.<br>
‘i did it last time!’ i said, safely sinking further<br>
into the peeling foam seat.<br>
but not everyone was safe.<br><br>

we stacked up the plates and the glasses<br>
and left the napkins on top,<br>
drenched in ketchup.<br>
‘damn good burgers’, someone said.<br>
‘damn good burgers’.<br><br>

we saw the man on the corner had gone<br>
by the time we left the restaurant.<br>
it was colder now, the wind had picked up<br>
but the sun still beamed down the winding street, ever-present.<br>
we took off again, meandering down the quiet streets<br>
but the radio had stopped working,<br>
unless you consider a car insurance advert<br>
doomed to loop indefinitely to be music.<br><br>

we were at the post office again, this time<br>
it was for me. i looked around me and grimaced;<br>
fifteen people who had no intention of being here,<br>
standing, staring, gradually wearing down<br>
into the brown carpet, seeping with something or other.<br>
the birds had left for the winter<br>
and the sky gradually turned darker<br>
and the light still hadn’t been fixed,<br>
and all that i could do was stand and stare.<br><br>

we were driving through the woods,<br>
the morning sun making the dirt on the windows<br>
shine like raindrops, and someone said<br>
‘what happened to that box we picked up?’<br>
and we didn’t speak for a moment<br>
and then someone else muttered under their breath,<br>
‘shit’.<br><br>

we stood on the street corner<br>
and tried to think of something to do.<br>
the day had been long, and<br>
the bowling alley was closed,<br>
and although none of us really liked bowling<br>
it was still disappointing.<br><br>

a man in a red suit approached us on the corner<br>
and turned into a side-street, his dark shoes<br>
glittering in the half-shade.<br>
there was a voice from across the road,<br>
it called to us and someone agreed,<br>
but i couldn’t make out the words.<br>
and far above us, the sun<br>
lay on the crest of the hills,<br>
far over the rooftops, waiting.<br><br>
