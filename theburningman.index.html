   THE BURNING MAN<br><br>

coughing and spluttering<br>
his blood spills onto the cobblestones<br>
the onlookers hold out their hands in appraisal<br><br>

he is drowned out by their adoration<br>
it flows through his open ribcage and into his heart<br>
it contorts his legs and arms<br><br>

he rises on his wooden table,<br>
a shell.<br>
he raises his arms to the sky<br>
the sun glows through his veins,<br><br>

his skin like paper,<br>
he collapses into the air, weighing nothing and<br>
made whole by their thunderous applause<br>
