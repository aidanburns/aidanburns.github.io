   CURRENT YEAR<br><br>

the warriors of love marched through the<br>
nighttime streets and held their torches high.<br>
bystanders watched from their windows with binoculars<br>
and nested hatred for the man living across from him.<br>
the warriors of love met their match, others<br>
found them, their torches sparked and let out<br>
their cries, their manifestos, thousands united<br>
under the colours.<br><br>

something was said, i have interviewed all that<br>
were present and have not yet found what it<br>
was, but it did not matter to them. all their<br>
flames ran on kerosene and the street was set<br>
alight, all fled at the threat, they fled to their<br>
banners and proudly presented that they were<br>
not the ones responsible for the burning homes.<br><br>

nobody watching was harmed, but they did not<br>
feel that way. the event had no real beginning<br>
and no ending, some left through the fire<br>
escape but most retreated up the metal stairs<br>
to their windows. they kept the fire going from<br>
their rooms three floors up and through steel<br>
reinforced elevators, as they cared<br>
passionately about their cause, buried under<br>
mountains of ash on the dirty city streets.<br><br>
