	<p><b>The Ancient Art of Stewcraft</b> is a "Suika-like" arcade game made for Global Game Jam 2025, following the theme "bubble".</p>
	<p>I designed and programmed the game from the 24th to the 26th of January, and Jaydn Jones provided the artwork. <a href="https://bigbyjones.itch.io/the-ancient-art-of-stewcraft">Check it out on itch.io!</a></p>

		<p>This is how the game looked on the morning of the first day: the number represents the framerate, as it struggles to manage all the physics objects!</p>

	<h1 class="subheading">Finding the core mechanic</h1>
	<p>I didn't immediately have an idea I was set on, so instead tried to find one I liked through experimentation. I started to program a cellular automata system based around bubbles that could attract and repel each other to see if anything interesting came of it. I enjoyed watching the bubbles bounce and glitch around, it resembled a bubbling stew!</p>
	<p>Once the bubbles settled, the arrows that showed their movement direction linked up in a uniform pattern, which reminded me of a match-three game. I liked the idea of building a physics-based match-three game using little colourful bubbles, and so built an algorithm for bubbles to recognise when they were in a group of like colours - I'd found my game mechanic!</p>

		<img src="stewcraft/image4.png" alt="the grey circle is now much more full, and the balls have little lines pointing in various directions">
	
		<p>This is how the game looked by the end of the second day: all of the major mechanics were in place, but it needed some polish!</p>
	
	</div>
	
	<br>
	<h1 class="subheading">Finding the fun</h1>
	<p>I tried to find an enjoyable presentation for the match-three system I had programmed. My course leader suggested that the colourful bubbles bouncing around resembled a gambling game, but I didn't want to program additional complex systems or UI. I let the player spin the pot with the mouse wheel, or stir the bubbles with a virtual spoon, but neither were very fun; the fun came from the bubbles being out-of-control!</p>
	<p>It was fun to watch the bubbles cascade over each other and match up unexpectedly, which reminded me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoz6UwCdMD4">the Suika fruit game</a>. I decided that the goal would be to try and work with the physics to make specific colour matches, while trying not to make the wrong matches by accident.</p>
	<p>After the name "The Ancient Art of Stewcraft" was revealed to me in a flash of divine insight, Jaydn drew the bubbles as little ingredients, the completed "meals" as bowls of stew, and then I coded them to fall into the customer's mouth. The game was almost done!</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<div class="desc-box" style="background-color: var(--flexoki-magenta-300)">
	
		<img src="stewcraft/image5.png" alt="The game is complete, with full graphics and sound, and Stu Craft awaiting his meal in the corner.">
	
		<p>With Jaydn's graphics, some simple sound effects, and a Kevin MacLeod arrangement of Canon in D, the game was complete!</p>
	
	</div>
	
	<br>
	<h1 class="subheading">Controlling the chaos</h1>
	<p>While the game was fun at this point, players remarked that it still felt too chaotic - they wanted more control over making incorrect matches. To remedy this, I allowed for players to "catch" meals before they fell into the customer's mouth if they could react fast enough. I tuned the speed at which the meals fell so that it was possible to grab them without lightning-fast reflexes, but I kept them fast enough that players didn't have to wait around for their correct meals to be registered.</p>
