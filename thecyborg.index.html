   THE CYBORG<br><br>

micheal drives a blue ford focus,<br>
eyes blinking in the backseat,<br>
the lights form shadow puppets on the dashboard,<br>
moving slowly back and forth,<br>
the world flattens into paper<br>
and lays itself on the ground,<br>
his blue dot glides across the rocks,<br>
but quickly ahead is a glass storefront,<br>
he sees himself, his pupils dilate for one moment,<br><br>

cries of metal, husks, armour,<br>
the others step away,<br>
he was lifted above, an ambassador,<br>
the light of one thousand tiny suns shining through him<br>
