	THE HOUSE BY THE SEA<br><br>
there’s a small house<br>
atop a cliff<br>
by the sea<br><br>

they’re happy there<br>
the house provides for them<br>
food, water, heating, books, toys<br><br>

there’s a known secret in the house<br>
only the youngest is unaware<br>
of the condition of their livelihood<br><br>

their father is unemployed<br>
every weekday, when he goes to work<br>
he sets them busy to something<br>
and casts himself into the sea,<br>
returning by the mid-afternoon,<br>
unharmed<br><br>

but, by attrition<br>
the fear that drove him<br>
was scraped away by the rocks,<br>
the granite he used to rebuild himself with<br><br>

they could feel it after a while,<br>
his eyes were glassy, his face wooden<br>
a silence permeated the house<br><br>

everything they had before<br>
was lost to the waves<br><br>
