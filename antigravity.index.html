   ANTIGRAVITY<br><br>

there’s a box buried in your backyard<br>

the same box everyone has,<br>

one your parents never knew about.<br><br>

it’s where your stuffed toys went<br>

when they were too old and loved to stay together,<br>

but they look different now<br>

they’re black and charred.<br><br>

the box sucks all the air out of the room,<br>

the scientists wear suits with black visors<br>

and they breathe through a tube in the wall.<br>

there’s no weight, there’s no life inside.<br>

it cannot tolerate them, it won’t let them breathe.<br>

your box is here for you and you alone<br><br>

this had to happen someday,<br>

we waited on your roof as the sky turned dark<br>

and the houses were destroyed.<br>

one thousand explosions echoed through the city<br>

as we all gave in to them.<br><br>

i stood with you as you opened your box in your garden,<br>

it was the dog you lost when you were nine.<br>

you held him tightly in your arms<br>

and then we were gone.<br><br>
