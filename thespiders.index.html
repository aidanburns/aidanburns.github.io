   THE SPIDERS<br><br>
   
   the rain beats down on the city<br>
from an empty sky<br>
there is nothing to hold them back,<br>
a dog with smiling teeth, <br>
miles away,<br>
miles underground,<br>
sitting, breathing behind you, but it's not there<br>
it's just the movement,<br>
more people leaving in flashes of light<br>
but when the machines break partway through,<br>
where will the thousands go<br>
with no bronze bull to hold them,<br>
hollow and light, to scatter back into the square,<br>
scurring under the eyes they built,<br>
the chains they cast and the masks they wove,<br>
choked by the hands of the mother they bore<br>
