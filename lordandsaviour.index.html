   LORD AND SAVIOUR<br><br>

Flying is nothing to be feared anymore.<br>

A dull whine permeates the morning sky,<br>

it shakes the lights in their fittings,<br>

shadows play across the grey speckled floors.<br><br>

Are we waiting for the Americans? People<br>

who know what they’re doing with these types of things.<br>

Planes have crashed together in the sky,<br>

the nation is in mourning.<br><br>

They wish to construct a great tower to show<br>

our strength, cower around its cast iron beams and<br>

pray that whatever mechanical bird or<br>

foe will come home to rest.<br><br>

We are not the ones here, it is them,<br>

If and when we leave, there will be others in our place.<br>

Don’t be concerned with the small things. Look up.<br><br>
