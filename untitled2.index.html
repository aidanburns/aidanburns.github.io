   The crying man watched the rain. Clutching his photograph tightly he moved through the park. The path was surrounded by cheering children, they played in the mud, and their parents stood by them.<br><br>
He reached the building, the hallway stretched onwards further than he could see, the walls and floor were pristine white marble. The man saw his future ahead of him endlessly, the frosted glass gave way into a vast viewing area. There were hundreds of identical black boxes two metres tall with an individual nametag on each. He held his own photograph closer to his chest.<br><br> 
His own box opened its arms and wept for the man's embrace. He bowed his head and moved inside, like meeting an old friend. They were so happy to see him. He smiled and closed the door. <br><br>
He raised his hand to the glass.<br>
'This photograph represents the happiest moment of my life.'<br>
'I wish to relive this moment endlessly.'<br>
I will live no happier life than this.' <br><br>
He stopped looking through the cutout in the door. The outside went dark, his box was being moved away. He had done it, the long-awaited peace flooded his mind, he would not think it would be so soon. He beat what he was fighting, his black box slotted into place. He won.<br><br>
