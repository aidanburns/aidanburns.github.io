   The King and Queen lay bleeding as he began to speak. The people looked on with wonder, they were free, the sky opened up for them and God looked down and outstretched a hand, and the name of God was Jacob.<br><br>
He spoke; “And as of today, no more harm will come to you. You have nobody to thank but yourselves, for your passion is what took the stones from under the castles of the Devil. Live as you did, but outstretch your hands to the sky and feel no chains pulling them towards the earth.”<br><br>
His people saluted him with both arms and he moved back behind the podium. Shambling slowly back towards their houses, they laid down their spears and kissed their children goodnight. In their dreams the open sky flooded their valleys and washed away their beds.<br><br>
When they awoke it had been raining for hours and water rushed down the cobbled streets and away, past the living spaces of their friends, extended families, workmates, people they had never seen before, and into the sewers, where it collected and pooled, sporadically, between cracks made by children throwing rocks against the walls when they got lost, holes made by rats, and it dripped into the centre of the earth, past the aforementioned Jacob, he chipped away at the stones from the basement of the castle, clutching a bag of things he stole from his people.<br><br>
They awoke to hear him murdered, from the bottom of the maze of uneven roads to the top where the castle stood lying. They rushed forward, up the steep hills yet were pushed down by their forces. Who had killed their leader? Someone spoke and it echoed off the walls and papers until it was a scream, filling the whole valley, coming down the chimneys and into their ears, there was no space between to move. Who was the one who betrayed the collective trust and didn’t sleep as one? Who was the one who betrayed the collective ideals and didn’t act as one? They looked through their windows and saw tiny cut-outs of the world.<br><br>
What was to happen now, what would fill the hole in the street? Their ropes were burned and frayed and their ladders were turned into daggers. Yet where was Caesar, back exposed, clearly painted, asleep and tied? Who had stolen him? There was nowhere to go but the windowsill, and there was nothing to do but chip away at the glass, getting a better view, scraping together the brilliant shards under the countertop.<br><br>
At that point the storm arrived, screaming across the hills, it tore down walls and drenched the city in blood. Left bare, what was left for them to do? As before, they looked up but there was no answer, as now they marched forward with purpose, in search of their Esau, they slit the throats of the guards in sight and they beat through the locks and the chains of the secret meeting halls and chambers and antechambers they conspired against for so long.<br><br>
The final wall was broken down, and there it was, the heart of the world, it beat faster and faster with each successive strike they dealt. What was left? The survivors fell to the ground and wept as the storm they built word by word tore open their chests and left them helpless. Climbing out of the passages, they felt him in front of them in the cold, but he was not there, all they had was gone. The memories of their hate were torn away by the cruel winds, they fell apart with the walls, limb by limb and eye by eye, their cries unheard.<br><br>
