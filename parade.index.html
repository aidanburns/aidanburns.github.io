   PARADE<br><br>
the walls had stood there for as long as they could remember<br>
so many attempts to tear them down had left them<br>
scratched and cracked everywhere<br><br>

after so long, they found him<br>
the one to free them<br>
he walked through the city to cheering crowds<br><br>

they gathered round as he smiled,<br>
slipping into the crack in the wall,<br>
disappearing into the blackness<br><br>

slowly, the walls fell that day,<br>
first dust,<br>
then everything came tumbling down,<br>
spilling over itself, violently<br>
smashing and shattering as it went<br><br>

long after they left the city behind,<br>
when they took their children by the hand<br>
and walked them over the rubble,<br>
his name was long forgotten,<br>
but what he did would stand forever<br><br>
