   RAINCOAT<br><br>
at the foot of the mountain<br>
my friend and I played,<br>
climbed trees and ran circles<br>
around each other until we were dizzy<br><br>

we started a race<br>
once to the oak tree and back<br>
she started strong, but i pulled ahead,<br>
grinning as i went<br>
through the snow<br>
over a log<br>
and through the air<br><br>

i held out my arms to break the fall<br>
the snow was kind enough to support me<br>
shaking my head<br>
and i looked up<br>
and my friend was nowhere to be seen<br><br>

after looking for the longest time<br>
i saw something up ahead<br>
a cave, leading deep into the mountain<br><br>

i pulled out my torch and headed inside<br>
the darkness was a cold blanket<br>
the light cut through,<br>
the cave giving out to a vast chasm<br>
lined with balconies and laughter<br>
and a stained-glass heart, bright red,<br>
floating a few metres off the ground<br><br>

i saw it speak,<br>
everything turned blue,<br>
i saw my friend with open arms,<br>
waiting for me<br><br>

i took her hand,<br>
and we floated,<br>
up through all the noise<br><br>
