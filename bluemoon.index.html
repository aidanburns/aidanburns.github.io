	BLUE MOON<br><br>
it happens about the same time every year<br>
thousands come, shambling over the mountains<br><br>

they could see through the fog<br>
something had gotten inside of them<br>
their guts were their compasses, weighing them down<br><br>

down from over the hills they came<br>
through the husks of burnt out buildings<br><br>

one at a time, they would lay down<br>
their arms outstretched<br>
drive nails through their hands and look up at the burning tree<br><br>

collapsing inwards,<br>
they gave themselves to the blaze<br><br>
