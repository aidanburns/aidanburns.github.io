   OPERATING TABLE<br><br>
she said,<br>
‘gather round children’<br><br>

she took the scalpel and cut,<br>
displaying the parts on a tray to the side<br><br>

a few smiled, they were interested<br>
‘now that’s how they did it’<br><br>

she brought out another tray<br>
full with little wooden scalpels<br><br>

30 scalpels for 30 children<br>
and after being taught the right technique<br><br>

they started digging in themselves<br>
pulling out sections and putting them back together again<br><br>

she pulled up a diagram<br>
and showed them what everything did<br><br>

that day they picked it clean<br>
scraping all they could from every word<br><br>

as they stared at the pile<br>
their smiles turned to shrugs<br><br>

the magic was gone<br>
it was all laid bare in front of them<br><br>

she started to build,<br>
a tower, laced with meaning and extravagance<br><br>

the kids tried to follow, but they couldn’t<br>
how could they write about something<br>
that wasn’t there anymore?<br><br>
