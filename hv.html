		<h1 class="subheading">Overview</h1>


		<p><b>Hellish Voyage</b> is a first-person point-and-click adventure game about a demon trapped on an
			unbelievably cursed cruise ship.</p>
		<p>I was responsible for programming the game and designing its systems. I also contributed to its design and
			writing.</p>
		<p>Its vertical slice was built alongside Luca Walker, Sylvie Freeman and Jaydn Jones from February to May 2024,
			and was based on an original concept by Vince Ljubimova. <a
				href="https://bigbyjones.itch.io/hellish-voyage">Check it out on itch.io!</a></p>

				conspiracy.</p>

		<br>

		<h1 class="subheading">Designing the systems</h1>
		<p>My biggest responsibility on the project was creating a framework to efficiently link between the dozens of
			scenes that constituted the SS Elysium while minimising repetition, tedium, and potential errors. I relied
			heavily on Godot's exported variables and reusable scripts to curtail the amount of bespoke coding required
			by a scene.</p>

		<br>

			<img src="hellish-voyage-media/playtesting.png"
				alt="Pictures from various playtesting sessions at different points in development, even including an early paper prototype!">

			<p>We used multiple rounds of playtesting to support our design: it was essential for ironing out gaps in
				the puzzles and polishing the UI.</p>

		</div>

		<br>
		<h1 class="subheading">Building a distinct style</h1>
		<p>Aside from my personal enthusiasm for Myst, the choice to use pre-rendered visuals instead of real-time
			rendering was initially made to guarantee visual fidelity while keeping our workflows simple. This
			additional visual polish also had the effect of giving the hallways of the SS Elysium an uncanny atmosphere,
			suitable for the game's demonic theme.</p>

		<div class="desc-box" style="background-color: var(--flexoki-red-300)">

			<img src="hellish-voyage-media/room-layouts.png"
				alt="Sketches of level designs from various points in development.">

			<p>The level design and visual presentation went through multiple iterations as we refined our systems,
				narrative, and puzzle design. We simplified the layouts for better readability from fixed perspectives,
				cut down on unnecessary detail, and streamlined navigation.</p>

		</div>

		<br>
		<h1 class="subheading">Designing for an event</h1>
		<p>The game was going to be exhibited at university events and played by members of the public, so we had to
			design it to be satisfying to complete within ten minutes. We took great care when building the narrative
			and tinkering with the puzzle difficulty to ensure we kept the player's attention and provided an engaging
			challenge.</p>
		<p>This lead us to structuring the game linearly, with one action unlocking another in sequence, but we allowed
			the player to deviate from their objective at any point to explore and talk to other characters. Players
			responded well to this, and enjoyed clicking on everything to find unique dialogue.</p>

				development!</p>

		<h1 class="subheading">Reflection</h1>

		<p>Looking back on the project now, I'm most proud of my work on the game's invisible "manager" systems that
			control its logic and continuity. The game appears technically simple, so I was surprised by the number of
			problems I had to solve to ensure its basic systems could scale to support the full experience. I found
			designing elegant solutions to streamline development to be a fun challenge that deepened my understanding
			of the Godot engine.</p>
		<p>I really enjoyed building Hellish Voyage and am proud of the silly little game we made. I hope you enjoy it
			too.</p>
