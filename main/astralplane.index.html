   ASTRAL PLANE<br><br>

it was the witching hour, as<br>

our bodies rose above our houses<br>

and joined hands in the sky.<br><br>

i saw thousands of strands<br>

like a spiderâ€™s web,<br>

made of rope or string, wires and arteries.<br><br>

i was there, joined together with you.<br>

knives and fishhooks bore into my chest<br>

and bound us together,<br><br>

made complete.<br>

the net of cables and grey indistinct buzzing<br>

sometimes spasmed with red and black<br><br>

as someone curled up and was torn apart.<br>

we held each other tightly as they slowly<br>

stopped existing.<br><br>

drifting out into space, we glimpsed a reflection<br>

in their eye, one thousand melted together in a knot<br>

like plastic toys.<br><br>

and in our hollow centre,<br>

a crying child<br>

begging to be let out.<br><br>
