   ELECTROMAGNETIC GRENADE<br><br>
i was a tumor until the world cut me away<br>
we fed off each other<br>
peace was established then broken again<br>
i contained your anger and maintained your image<br><br>

i sent a message to you<br>
you were too blind to see<br>
what we were doing to each other<br>
you stood on me and talked about your problems<br><br>

i grew away<br>
i grew out of you<br><br>

we developed in isolation there<br>
we changed over time<br>
i still believed you, i hadn't learned<br><br>

i watched you move away slowly<br>
in the back of my head<br>
i look across the room and see just how far you've fallen <br><br>
