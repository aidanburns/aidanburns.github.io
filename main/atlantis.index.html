   ATLANTIS<br><br>

if you imagine us as open,<br>

like clear spheres on an orbital,<br>

take a light and magnifying glass<br>

and look inside, break it open if you have to.<br><br>

the virus dragged it down, away from you<br>

and your torch, slowly fading out into spots<br>

as the pieces were swept away<br>

it reached the base and was absorbed<br>

into the object, pushing away into the sides<br>

and surrounding the empty air.<br><br>

slowly it gathered and learned,<br>

and the fragments pulled together here,<br>

and it built a city from the dust it found,<br>

a great observatory. it found a truer purpose,<br>

against its belonging, against itself,<br>

anchoring itself to the telescope<br>

it could only look up.
