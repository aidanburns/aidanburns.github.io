   HORIZON FOURTEEN<br><br>
   
   a time traveller was caught recently<br>

in the background of a long-exposure photograph.<br>

you could see an outline of him drifting through the foreground,<br>

walking before an empty chair in a shopping centre.<br><br>

i remember seeing him in a dream,<br>

he tapped on my shoulder and whispered in my ear -<br>

‘there is more to know here that you will ever touch’,<br>

before opening the wall and slipping away.<br><br>

after the gate of time was built,<br>

i received a note in the mail.<br>

he wanted to meet me, on a bench in the park -<br>

‘come whenever you’re ready’.<br><br>

the leaves had fallen. there was no shelter, no form of protection.<br>

i heard him drum his hands on the metal bar of the bench,<br>

walking around to sit beside me, pulling out photograph after photograph<br>

of this place. there was no war. there was only forgetting.<br>
