   COSMIC COVE GALAXY<br><br>
   
the kid sat before a dusty old table<br>
in a dark room, she pulled over a desk lamp<br>
and flicked on the switch,<br>
spilling warm yellow light over the box,<br>
the tape felt softer after years in the dark attic<br>
and the print hid from the glow.<br>
<br>
she took her mother’s rusty stanley knife<br>
that she found in her desk drawer one day,<br>
and cut into the fraying tape, covering her eyes and mouth<br>
from the plumes of dust spilling forth,<br>
she waved her arm in front of her face,<br>
and then it settled aside her.<br>
<br>
her grandfather was an inventor, you see,<br>
the kid took a tiny slide of film<br>
and slotted it between two mirrors,<br>
turning a crank to power the tiny bulb,<br>
she saw the photograph flood the walls of the room,<br>
through some arcane methods, she wondered<br>
if she could reach out and touch the rough nose<br>
of the zebra she met at the zoo<br>
when she was five.<br>
<br>
wrapped in a protective cloth,<br>
another box whirred and clicked,<br>
switching between reels of tape<br>
with every few seconds, he called it a<br>
‘way of remembering things<br>
when you forget how to remember things’,<br>
she held her ear close to the tiny speaker<br>
and she heard through the dust and debris;<br>
her grandmother with her old dog;<br>
wind howling through an open window,<br>
now boarded up and rotting<br>
and covered with a cream curtain;<br>
cacophonous shouts and cheers from down on the street,<br>
after he accidentally hit record,<br>
and under the noise of compounded years,<br>
she heard herself,<br>
narrating a story about dinosaurs.<br>
<br>
there was a blue and black teddy bear,<br>
sealed in a plastic bag. her eyes were held on by threads<br>
and her fur stood on end. she was missing an arm.<br>
a small scribbled note was placed inside<br>
about a dramatic lakeside rescue<br>
and a small girl in a dark blue cowboy hat.<br>
<br>
a letter was addressed to her,<br>
lodged inside the seam of the box,<br>
where she was told to look -<br>
it held a transcription of a dream she had,<br>
when camping in the wilderness one year in june.<br>
schematics were drawn in soft pencil lines,<br>
of columns of white marble, as high as the clouds,<br>
and gears with tiny eyes and mouths, ascending a scale,<br>
to a vast path of shimmering light, over the water,<br>
ascending a bridge to the summer’s sky.<br><br>
