  BE IN THIS PLACE<br><br>

but after your lungs are crushed and your ribs shatter,<br>

no angel will reach down and shield your heart<br>

and weave the tissues back together.<br>

i couldn’t stand above you, crushed over the earth -<br>

speak to me. it’s been hell trying to reach you.<br><br>

say what you mean. you told me once<br>

that if you ever disappeared i would know where to find you.<br>

you looked straight forward, your hands held still.<br>

i tilted my head and looked into your eyes,<br>

and for the life of me i couldn’t figure out what you meant.<br><br>

the last time that i saw you look directly at me<br>

you asked if i believed in ghosts.<br>

we sat on the roof of your old house<br>

and i felt them all around us.<br>

washed over by the heavy sky, we gazed upwards<br>

and counted the total suns that we could see,<br>

your cold hand passing through mine.<br>
