   HAILSTORM<br><br>
   
but the reflection was different every time<br>
she looked through the shimmering window<br>
and out into the storm; every shard cut through<br>
the clouds of fog with force, she saw knives dance<br>
and glint with gold, whales pulse with breath,<br>
lurching their ribs outwards like fluttering bugs,<br>
glacial water pooling in an infinite cavern, a ripple<br>
and a whisper. that cold fell deep beneath under her skin,<br>
it flowed through her nerves before diving lower<br>
and setting in a web, pressing her shoulders down<br>
with an eventual exhale. she tilted her head,<br>
growing a smile with wide eyes, and a hand<br>
reached out into the storm. gradually, the shaking<br>
would start, beating cuts into the soft dirt,<br>
the air buzzing with electric shocks. she dug her fingers in,<br>
pushed her weather-battered head upright<br>
with eyes clenched shut, and tried to feel<br>
like nothing was there. holding her arms out,<br>
each step collapsed canyons in her gut,<br>
forming brutal columns of rock, melting like hair in rain,<br>
the waves of sand rolling over her face.<br>
she felt the foundations. there wasn’t space inside,<br>
she couldn’t take the cold. standing at the window,<br>
she balanced atop the knife edge, watching mirrored<br>
half-movements beneath the water, flailing dances<br>
in the open air. the form steadied her breath,<br>
span thoughts into soft shapes, splitting and holding tight,<br>
drifting in a double helix through the warmth of the trick,<br>
until she’s crushed under the weight of the hail,<br>
just hearing a soft voice, echoing inside and out,<br>
‘hazel, are you coming in?’<br>
