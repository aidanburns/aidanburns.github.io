   WHIRLWIND<br><br>

a soft breeze brushes over the rose petals<br>
in the reflecting pool outside the old house.<br>
she’s playing the harp next to the ocean,<br>
on the balcony, the notes glide atop the waves<br>
and slip silently into the water, fluttering<br>
in the sun, they drift deeper, folding away<br>
like thin sheets of origami paper, they glow,<br>
burn up, turn translucent. she threw the sheets<br>
onto the ground outside the church, etched<br>
a smiley-face into the snow with her heel.<br>
she thought about quitting. she thought about<br>
her syllabus, climbing back into the tar pit<br>
of nostalgia that lead her here, wasting time,<br>
watching clocks gradually reverse, living<br>
backwards, remembering littleroot and juniper,<br>
falling asleep in her childhood wardrobe. here<br>
she would begin to dream again, learn to float<br>
weightlessly and live between places, live<br>
in silent free fall through a life worth forgetting.<br>
years ago, they left a chalk outline on her bedroom<br>
floor, a ghost deep-set within. the sun broke<br>
through the crumbling walls and into the darkened room,<br>
the vapour shook its head, yearned to stand,<br>
crafted form from comatose delirium. she<br>
shielded her eyes for a moment, and slowly unfurled<br>
out of the ground, finger by finger,<br>
limping out of the house and reaching upright<br>
over the reflecting pool. placing her hands<br>
into the cold water, the haze of her skin reformed,<br>
wove memory into flesh, and in the water<br>
she held her own reflection, still transparent<br>
in the half-space, and spoke between selves;<br>
“riley, are you there?”<br>
