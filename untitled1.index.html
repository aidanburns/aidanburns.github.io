   This is going to be a terrible day, one of those days when itâ€™s best to stay in bed because everything is going to turn out bad, they would find out what he did to them. His thoughts took over his frontal lobe like a viral infection. He saw himself with a third person camera, he saw the infection spread down his body, they gained control of his actions and then his movement. They manifested as small things, nonsensical activities. He often questioned his reasoning, he often questioned whether he was in his little camera bubble looking in, or stuck in his swollen, raging head. <br><br>
He wrestled himself out of bed. They scurried away when he looked in the mirror they knew their place then, he never knew they were there. He often wonders if his perspective on himself is fixed or predetermined, who chose what time he thought in. <br><br>
One day he believed he found the cure to his illness, he found his solution in other people. I honestly believed that when I was with my friends I could not be hurt, I was an agent of my own free well. But then again they started to move inside his skull, they filled his head with gravel, his inner monologue started in ways completely disconnected from his point. That was a lie, he had no point overall, he simply rambled until the time was up. He moved further and further away from his physical body, his head crammed into a little glass camera box. They reeled him further and further into the sky on a bit of string tied to his spine. He was finally free from all limitations of thought and structure, he drifted up into the clouds. He saw where he had been before, it was so small and insignificant. He was something larger now, larger than life. One kind man cut the ribbon on his red helium brain, he flew further and further and the glass cracked around his head, he inflated faster and faster and faster, he could see nothing anymore, he grew until he moved out of everything we can see. He bit his cheek and started to distort violently; he was truly flying now, he was truly free from everything he knew, and with that, he was gone. <br><br>
